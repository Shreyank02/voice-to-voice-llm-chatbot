# 🎙️ Voice-to-Voice LLM Bot

A real-time conversational assistant that allows users to speak into a microphone, processes the input using speech recognition, generates intelligent responses using a Large Language Model (LLM), and replies back using speech synthesis — all in a seamless Streamlit web interface.

- 🌐 **Streamlit UI**: Interactive web app to control the conversation easily.
- 🔁 **Conversation Memory**: Maintains a history of the dialogue.
